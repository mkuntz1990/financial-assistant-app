# Electron Desktop App

This folder contains the Electron wrapper for the Financial Assistant App.

## Usage

1. Make sure your backend server is running (see main README).
2. Run `npm install` in this folder to install Electron.
3. Run `npm start` to launch the desktop app.

The Electron app loads the local frontend and connects to the backend as usual.
