## How to Direct Copilot for the Financial Assistant Roadmap

Paste the following statement to Copilot to work through the FINANCIAL_ASSISTANT_ROADMAP.md, one step at a time, with all standards and test data requirements:

---

**"Let's work on the next unchecked item (only that one) on the FINANCIAL_ASSISTANT_ROADMAP.md. Make sure with me before you start that you are going to work on the correct item. Be sure to update test data at the end if necessary to test the new feature. The test data needs to be realistic for a family that only makes around 60k a year right now combined (the data doesn't have to be replaced from what was made in the past, instead just add some more data so it can test this new feature). Also be sure to maintain the modular design. Do all of this for me, keep everything according to the critical implementation instructions in the roadmap on lines 8-136. Do not stop during the implementation to ask me what I want to do, just do what you think is appropriate for that step (don't ask me what I want to do, tell me what I need to do). Also make sure to keep to the same type of 'theme' or complexity as the rest of the app that is already created."**

- Copilot will check off each item as it is completed, following all standards and updating test data as needed.
