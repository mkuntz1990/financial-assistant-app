# GitHub Setup Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (https://github.com/new).
2. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (these will be added locally).
3. After creation, copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/financial-assistant-app.git).
4. In this project root, run:

    git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main

5. Continue development and push changes regularly.
