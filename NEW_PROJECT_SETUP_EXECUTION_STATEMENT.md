## How to Direct Copilot for the New Project Setup Roadmap

Paste the following statement to Copilot to work through the NEW_PROJECT_SETUP_ROADMAP.md, one step at a time, with all standards and modularity requirements:

---

**"Let's work on the next unchecked item (only that one) on the NEW_PROJECT_SETUP_ROADMAP.md. Make sure with me before you start that you are going to work on the correct item. Maintain modular design and follow best practices for project setup, code clarity, and documentation. Do not stop during the implementation to ask me what I want to do, just do what you think is appropriate for that step (don't ask me what I want to do, tell me what I need to do)."**

---

- Copilot will check off each item as it is completed, following all standards and maintaining modularity as needed.
